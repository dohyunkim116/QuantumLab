    "The accuracy of the estimated value through Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and its probability of success depend on the number of qubits employed in QPE circuits. Therefore, one might want to know the necessary number of qubits to achieve the targeted level of QPE performance, especially when the phase that needs to be determined cannot be decomposed in a finite bit binary expansion. In Part 1 of this lab, we examine the number of qubits required to accomplish the desired accuracy and the probability of success in determining the phase through QPE."
